* Aasaan transliteration

#aasaan
The *Aasaan* (easy, convenient) style of Persian/Arabic
transliteration is based on attempts to find a readable, easily edited
source format that is unambiguous in all cases and sufficient to
faithfully reproduce the original Arabic/Persian text.

This style borrows from the following sources:

  - Bahá'í ``House Style'', as used by the Guardian and printed in
    Bahá'í books.  By itself it is not sufficient because: It is
    difficult to represent in non-Unicode alphabets, and it is
    ambiguous in several cases (tanviin, for example).
  
  - ArabTeX encoding.  This format is very exact, but somewhat
    laborious and difficult to proofread/edit.
  
  - Tarjuman postings.  There are several people who post informally
    to Tarjuman using a style that makes for easy reading, though it
    is also not exact enough in all cases.  *Aasaan* aims at retaining
    the readability and natural form of this style, while increasing
    its accuracy.

** Transliteration rules

Here are the rules for *Aasaan* transliteration:

  Item | Coding | Example
  Consonants | b p t j d s r z ` f q k g l m n v y h | bad
  ``Two letter'' consonants | th ch kh dh sh zh gh | shuq
  Breaking ``two letter'' | (separate with =_=) | <verbatim>mas_hat</verbatim>
  ``Dotted'' consonants | .h .s .d .t .z | .sub.h
  Carrier alif | (from context) | alif
  alif baa madda | (from context) | aathar
  Defective alif | <verbatim>_a</verbatim> | <verbatim>al-ll_ah</verbatim>
  Vowels | aa ii uu | iiqaan
  Diphthong vowels | ey uw | kheyr, khuwd
  Silent vaav-alif | waa wuu wii | khwaahar
  Silent final vaav | o | to, do
  Non-silent final hih | H | diH
  Explicit hamzih | ' | aabaa', bahaa'ii (different from bahaa-ii, although both are printed the same)
  tanviin | N | nisbataN
  tanviin (force alif) | NA | shey'aNA
  tah marbutah | T | nisbaTaN
  alif maqsuurah | Y | muusY
  tashdiid | (double the consonant) | mubashshir
  tashdiid for `eyn | ~` | tasha~`aba
  izafih | -i | khaanih-i, buu-i, diH-i (yih or hamzih is generated as needed)
  Non-specific suffix | -ii | jaa-ii, duust-ii
  Definite object suffix raa | -raa | kitaab-raa (spacing before raa is reduced)
  Prefix bih | bi- | bi-va.tan, bi-ism (alif is retained if needed)
  Prefix mii | mii mii- | miiraftam, mii-iistaadam (mii- separates the prefix)
  Plural suffixes | -haa -aan | baagh-haa, duust-aan
  Copula suffixes | -am -ii -ast -iim -iid -and | tashnih-am (separating alef is generated if needed)
  Possessive suffixes | -at -ash | dard-at, .talab-ash
  Arabic al- | al- (if a doubled letter, use as-, az-, al-l, etc.) | ar-ra.hm_an, al-.hukm
  Quotes | <verbatim>`` ''</verbatim> | <verbatim>``hal min maziid''</verbatim>

** C++ conversion module

In order to make this style more useful, a C++ module (=aasaan.cpp=)
is offered that can translate this style into any of the following
output formats:

  - HTML Unicode 2.0
  - ArabTeX
  - HTML transliterated (in Bahá'í House Style)
  - LaTeX transliterated (in Bahá'í House Style)

* Chaap publishing tool

#chaap
To ease the publication and management of translations, I have written
a publishing tool called *chaap*.  It uses a very simple input format,
and from this format can produce any of the following forms of output:

  - HTML or LaTeX
  - Original text or transliteration
  - Bilingual or mono-lingual

** Input format

The input format is very basic, even if the technical description
sounds complex:

  1. Alternate verses in the original language (encoded in *aasaan*
     style), with the translation.
  2. At least one line of the original verse must occur in column one
     (that is, have no preceding whitespace).
  3. Conversely, every line of the translation must begin with
     whitespace.
  4. The original verse and the translation should be separated by a
     blank line.
  5. Separate these verse/translation pairs with a blank line, except
     when they occur in different paragraphs, when they should be
     separated with two blank lines.
  6. Intra-verse whitespace is allowed, for the sake of readability.
  7. For poetic verse, precede the text with a greater-than sign,
     followed by at least one space.
  8. For Persian/Arabic poetry, if you wish each line to be stretched to
     the same width, specific the width before the greater-than
     character.  Example:

<example>
2in> kufr-i kaafir-raa va diin-i diindaar-raa
2in> dharrih-i dard-at dil-i `a.t.taar-raa
</example>

** Example text suitable as input to chaap

From the *Seven Valleys*:

<example>
va ba`d
maraatib-i seyr-i saalikaan-raa
az maskan-i khaakii
  bi-va.tan-i il_ahii
haft rutbih mu`ayan namuudih-and

    And further
    The stages that mark the wayfarer's journey
    from the abode of dust
      to the heavenly homeland
    are said to be seven.

chunaanchih ba`.d-ii haft vaadii
  va ba`.d-ii haft shahr
dhikr kardih-and

    Some have called
    these Seven Valleys,
      and others, Seven Cities.

va guftih-and kih saalik
  taa az nafs hijrat nanamaayad
  va iin asfaar-raa .tey nakunad
bi-ba.hr-i qurb va vi.saal vaarid nashavad
va az khamr-i biimithaal nachishad

    And they say that until the wayfarer
      taketh leave of self,
      and traverseth these stages,
    he shall never reach to the ocean of nearness and union,
    nor drink of the peerless wine.
</example>

** Example result:

Here is what the various output formats look like, using the above
text as input:

  - [[sample.html][HTML using Unicode (bilingual)]]
  - [[samplelit.html][HTML transliterated (bilingual)]]
  - [[sample.pdf][ArabTeX (bilingual)]]
  - [[samplelit.pdf][LaTeX transliterated (bilingual)]]
  - [[sampleo.html][HTML using Unicode (mono-lingual)]]
  - [[samplelito.html][HTML transliterated (mono-lingual)]]
  - [[sampleo.pdf][ArabTeX (mono-lingual)]]
  - [[samplelito.pdf][LaTeX transliterated (mono-lingual)]]

* Seven Valleys transcription

I have been working to provide a complete transcription of the *Seven
Valleys* in a format usable by the *chaap* tool.  Persian friends have
been helping provide vowellization.  At the same time, I have been
compiling an extracted glossary from Steingass (see below) of all the
words used in that text.

* Lughat glossary publishing tool

#lughat
To aid in the production of glossaries to accompany a text, I've
written a small script called *lughat*, which reads in files composed
of glossary definitions, and then formats them into either LaTeX
or HTML output, with appropriate reference links, etc.

** Glossary file format

See the documentation at the top of the =lughat= script for
information on the required glossary format.  Note that the Steingass
ASCII dictionary provided in the set of tools is also in this format.

* Justan dictionary search tool

#justan
The Python script "justan.py" can be used to quickly and easily search
the Steingass dictionary (see below).  Simply run it, and then type in
successive search terms.  Once the Index has been built/loaded,
searches happen very fast.

* Steingass Persian dictionary in electronic format

#steingass
Thanks to the East Asian dictionary project making the Steingass text
available using Unicode transliteration encoding, I was able to
download and convert the Steingass dictionary into *lughat* format,
using *aasaan* transliteration.

This makes it possible to republish the entire dictionary as a PDF
file, using vowellized Arabic script throughout, rather than the
combination of unvowellized script and transliterated alphabet that
the current print editions use.
